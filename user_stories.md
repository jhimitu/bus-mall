# Bus Mall User Stories

- as a product owner, I want an app for conducting customer surveys so that I can get a good idea of what products will sell.
- as a product owner, I want the app to display images of our potential inventory three at a time so that users can vote on which product they like best
- as a developer, I want to create a feature that generates random displays of images, 3 by 3, so that users can compare a variety of items.
- as a user, I want to be able to quickly vote so that the experience does not take too much of my time.
- as a product owner, I want the app to tally up all the votes and show them in a final review format so that I can easily get a sense of where most of the customer votes are and what products they like.
- as a developer, I want to create a feature that keeps track of every click on each image so that I can store the total number of clicks to be tallied at the end of the voting session.
- as a user, I want a visually appealing experience so my voting is focused solely on the products and not on how bad the app looks.
- as a developer, I want to keep user experience in mind as I style the app so that each visitor has a pleasant experience.
